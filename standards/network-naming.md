# gcrNet Naming Standards

## Purpose

The purpose of this Standard is to identify network naming conventions for use within the gcrNet. These conventions are important in organizing the gcrNet infrastructure that is used by multiple institutions across distributed geographic locations.

## Scope

This Standard primarily applies to gcrNet technical teams. However, researchers that place equipment should follow this standard if at all possible.

## Requirements

### Network Hostnames

Network hostnames are divided into two categories: core and non-core infrastructure hostnames. Core infrastructure is the infrastructure that is used to provide the basic gcrNet services, managed by the gcrNet Technical Team, and available to all gcrNet participants. All other infrastructure is considered non-core infrastructure. The use of campus identifiers assists in administration of the network. 

**Core Infrastructure** - hostnames should not include any campus specific information and follow the format of *host.gcrnet.org*.

**Non-Core Infrastructure** - hostnames should be prefixed with a campus identifier followed by a '-' in the format of *location-host.gcrnet.org*. Current location identifiers include:

| Campus | Hostname Example |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| UNC Greensboro | *uncg-server1.gcrnet.org* |
| NC A&T State University | *ncat-server1.gcrnet.org* |
| JSNN | *jsnn-server1.gcrnet.org* |

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this standard should be reviewed by the joint gcrNet technical team and listed below.
